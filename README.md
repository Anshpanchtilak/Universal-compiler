I will build a professional-grade, browser-based Universal Compiler that supports Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

This application will use:

Ace Editor: For a professional, VS Code-like editing experience with syntax highlighting.

Piston API: A powerful, public engine to compile and execute code remotely (so you don't need local compilers).

Tailwind CSS: For a modern, responsive, dark-themed UI.

Split Layout: To allow coding, inputting data, and viewing output simultaneously.

⚡ features
Multi-Language Support: Pre-configured for Java, C++, Python, and JS.

Smart Boilerplate: Automatically loads the correct starter code (e.g., public class Main) when you switch languages.

Standard Input: Dedicated box to provide runtime inputs (essential for Scanner or cin).

Real-time Output: Captures stdout and stderr.

🚀 How to use your Universal Compiler
I have generated a single-file application named index.html. It is self-contained and ready to run.

Key Features:

Multiple Languages: Use the dropdown in the top navigation to switch between Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

Boilerplate Code: It automatically generates the correct public class Main for Java or #include headers for C++ when you switch languages.

Input Support: If your code uses Scanner (Java) or cin (C++), simply type the input into the "Standard Input" box on the bottom right before clicking Run.

Remote Execution: It connects to the Piston API, which is a powerful engine used by many competitive coding platforms, ensuring your code runs in a real Linux environment.

Note: For Java, keep the class name as Main because the file is virtually saved as Main.java for the compiler to find it.
